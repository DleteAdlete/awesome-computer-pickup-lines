> Are you a computer whiz… it seems you know how to turn my software to hardware?

> [me != me]. [me += you].

> A life without you, would be like a computer without an OS.

> Anonymity makes me even more handsome.

> Are you a computer keyboard? Because you’re my type.

> Are you a double? The thought of you always floats inside my head.

> You are my semicolon; always present in everything I do.

> Are you an angel, because your texture mapping is divine!

> My love for you cannot be measured with an int, not with a long, and not even with an array. It is out of bounds and infiniteâ€¦.

> You are my initializer: without you, my life would point to nothing (null).

> I am the field attribute in your class: I canâ€™t exist unless you do.

> I’ll have to try again tomorrow, because you’ve already exceeded my bandwidth.
